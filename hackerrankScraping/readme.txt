i tried the same project(scraping hackerrank submissions) using scrapy framework. but i didn't solve this yet.
i can login but can't access all the submission url which are visible after login.
after google it, i thought that the problem might be for ajax.
but another thing can be that the problem occers because of cockies or headers.

i will work with it soon.
